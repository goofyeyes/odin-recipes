    <h2><div class ="des">Description</div></h2>
    <p class="yu"> A Cuban sandwich is a variation of a ham and cheese sandwich that likely originated in cafes catering to Cuban workers in Tampa or Key West, two early Cuban immigrant communities in Florida centered on the cigar industry. Later on, Cuban exiles and expatriates brought it to Miami, where it is also very popular.</p>
       <h3><div class = "po">Ingredients</div></h3>
       <ul>
        <div class= "yi">

        <li> ½ cup mayonnaise

        <li> 1 pound thinly sliced fully cooked pork

        </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons butter, melted

       <h3><div class = "po">Steps</div></h3>

        <li> <div class="op">On each sandwich, place and equal amount of Swiss cheese, ham and pork in exactly that order. Place a few pickles onto each one, and put the top of the roll onto the sandwich. Brush the tops with melted butter. </div></li>

        <li> <div class="op">Press each sandwich in a sandwich press heated to medium-high heat. If a sandwich press is not available, use a large skillet over medium-high heat, and press the sandwiches down using a sturdy plate or skillet. Some indoor grills may be good for this also. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, keeping sandwiches pressed. If using a skillet, you may want to flip them once for even browning. Slice diagonally and serve hot.</div> </li>
